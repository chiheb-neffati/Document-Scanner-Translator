# Document-Scanner-Translator (Android)
## Hello !
Hi, I am chiheb, a Second year embedded systems engineering student from tunisia and this is my first android apps developement project!
## What does this app do ?
This application allows you to get text from a photo that you either take with your camera or get from your phone gallery.
After extracting the text, the phone identifies the language of that text and then you have the choice of either scanning another image or the choice to translate that text.
## What did i use to develop it ?
Well, first of all, i used :
  -Android Studio and Java to develop the app.
  -Google ML-kit (https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) for the OCR, Language identification and Translation models (This made it both easier and faster to complete the project since i had no prior experience with machine learning, also the documentation was very helpful !) 
## how to get the project?
### Step 1 : Requirements :
First of all you need :
  - Android studio installed on your computer.
  - Git.
### Step 2 : Cloning :
To open this project locally on Android Studio you need to run this command in your Command Line Tool : `git clone https://github.com/chiheb420/Document-Scanner-Translator [Folder_Name]`
### Step 3 : Opening the project in Android studio :
Open Android Studio. Go to File -> New -> Import Project. Then choose the folder you cloned the project to, then click Next->Finish. It will build the Gradle automatically and'll be ready for you to use.
## Any suggestions ?
This project is by no means perfect !, it was an oppurtunity for me to get my feet wet in this field and i am still learning and for that if you encounter any issues or if you have any suggestions or advices pls feel free to let me know !
